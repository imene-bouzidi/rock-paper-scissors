# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game built as part of **The Odin Project – JavaScript Foundations**.

The goal of this project is to practice:
- JavaScript basics
- Functions and conditionals
- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners
- Basic CSS styling

---

## 🕹️ How It Works

- The player chooses **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** by clicking a button.
- The computer randomly selects a choice.
- The result of each round is displayed on the page.
- The score is updated after every round.
- The game ends when either the player or the computer reaches **5 points**.
